## 7.1-mam-public-send.js - sending public messages

This tutorial teaches how to send a public MAM message

## Step-by-step explanation of 7.1-mam-public-send.js


Import the Iota MAM library as Mam

Import the trytes converter

```
///////////////////////////////
// MAM: Publish messages to Public Stream
///////////////////////////////

const Mam = require('@iota/mam')
const { asciiToTrytes } = require('@iota/converter')
```

Use DevNet

```
let mamState = Mam.init('https://nodes.devnet.thetangle.org:443')
``

There are three MAM states:  public, private, and restricted.  Set the MAM state to 'public' so this message can be viewed by the general public


```
mamState = Mam.changeMode(mamState, 'public')
```

Use an asynchronous publisher


```
const publish = async data => {

```

Convert the message to trytes and create a MAM message

```

  // Convert the JSON to trytes and create a MAM message
  const trytes = asciiToTrytes(data)
  const message = Mam.create(mamState, trytes)

```

Think of MAM like a radio channel.  You are listening to one of your favorite tunes.  The state of the radio reflects the song currently being played.  The MAM state reflects the latest message.  We must update the state to reflect our message.


```
  // Update the MAM state to the state of this latest message
  // We need this so the next publish action knows it's state
  mamState = message.state
```

Because async was used, you must use await in order to attach the MAM message to the message stream in the Tangle.  In this example, the message payload is the data being passed.  
In the first example, the payload is 'Super public message'.  The message address is the address being used.  A depth of 3 is used because 3 is recommended when using DevNet and 4 is recommended for MainNet.
A mwm of 9 is used for DevNet, 14 would be used for MainNet.

A message containing the address and the message root are printed to the console.  This can be used to fetch the MAM message.


```
  // Attach the message
  await Mam.attach(message.payload, message.address, 3, 9)
  console.log('Sent message to the Tangle!')
  console.log('Address: ' + message.root)
}

```

Two examples publishing two different messages

```
publish('Super public message')
publish('Super public message2')

```
