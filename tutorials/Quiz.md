In the above example, which address is a deposit address?
 
(a)ADDRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSA

(b)ADDRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSB

(c)ADDRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSC

(d)ADDRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSD

(e) All the above

```
Answer: (e) All the above

In this example, each address is a deposit address because each address contains iota tokens
```

5. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), how many transactions must be approved before a bundle is confirmed?

a)	1

b)	50%

c)	70%

d)	100%

```
Answer: d)	100%

Bundles are atomic meaning 100% of the transactions must be confirmed in order for the bundle to be processed
```

6. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), the _______ uses their ______ to send funds?
 
 (a) Sender, seed
 
 (b) Sender, address
 
 (c) Recipient, seed
 
 (d) Recipient, address

```
Answer:  (a) Sender, seed

The sender uses their seed to send funds
```

7. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), the _______ uses their ______ to receive funds?
 
 (a) Sender, seed
 
 (b) Sender, address
 
 (c) Recipient, seed
 
 (d) Recipient, address

```
Answer: (d) Recipient, address

The recipient uses their address to receive funds
```

8. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), funds are stored in the

(a) seed

(b) address

```
Answer: (b) address

Funds are stored in addresses
```

9. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), what should you always keep secret? 

a) seed 

b) address 

c) hash

```
Answer:  a) seed 

>Never share your seed
```

10. From [4.send-tokens](4.send-tokens.md), how many times should you use a deposit address? 

a) never 

b) as many as you want 

c) 1

```
Answer:  c) 1

Only use a deposit address once.  Otherwise, you make it easier for someone to 
decipher your secret key and steal your iota tokens
```

### Additional Study Questions

11. Which of the following can appear as 81-trytes or 90 characters? 

a) address 

b) bundle 

c) hash 

d) seed

```
Answer:  a) address 

The address is 81-trytes but a checksum is often added so it appears as a
90 character string.  Trinity wallet always uses the 90 character string
so users can easily differentiate between the seed and address.  This
provides additional security so users remember to safeguard their 
80-tryte seed and share their 90 character address
```

12. What should you use to keep track of addresses attached to a seed? 

a) Index 

b) Address 

c) Checksum 

```
Answer:  a) Index 

One seed many have many addresses.  Each address has a unique index starting at 
index 0 and incrementing by 1.  Addresses are processed in order of their index
```

13. How many addresses can be generated for a seed? 

a) 1 

b) As many as you need 

c) 2 

d) 100

```
Answer:  b) As many as you need 

One seed may have multiple addresses.  Be mindful, having many addresses requires
more processing time to compute the total seed balance.  You may want to use
multiple seeds and select an optimum number of addresses per seed to meet your needs.
```

14. Where is the balance stored? 

a) Seed 

b) Address 

c) A and B

```
Answer:  b) Address 

Iota tokens are stored in addresses.  A seed balance is the summary of all 
the associated addresses
```

15. What happens when two transactions are sent simultaneously? 

a)	Error message

b)	Account overdrawn message

c)	First TX confirms but second remains pending

d)	API fails

```
Answer:  c)	First TX confirms but second remains pending

The first TX processed by a node will confirm but the second TX remains pending.  
This prevents a double spend situation where the same tokens are used twice
```

16. What does the signatureMessageFragment contain?

(a) User-defined message

(b) Signature

(c) 9's

Example of signatureMessageFragment containing a message converted to trytes:

signatureMessageFragment: 'SBYBCCKBEAFCCDFDZCGDWCCDDDEAXCGDEAHDCDDDFA99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999...',

signature.  Otherwise, the `signatureMessageFragment` 
is blank (shown as all 9's) or contains a user-defined message padded with 9's.
```

17. Which of the following would generate the first address?
 
(a) ```  .getNewAddress(hash, { index: 1, total: 1 })```

(b) ```  .getNewAddress(bundle, { seed: 1, address: 1 })```

(c) ```  .getNewAddress(seed, { index: 1, total: 0 })```

(d) ```  .getNewAddress(seed, { index: 0, total: 1 })```

```
Answer:  (d) ```  .getNewAddress(seed, { index: 0, total: 1 })```

In order to generate an address, you need a seed.  So options (a) and (b) are incorrect.  
(a) attempts to use a hash.  
(b) attempts to use a bundle.  
The parameters in option (c) are backwards.  It would not be useful to generate zero addresses.
Option (d) is correct.  Choose index zero and a total of one address to be generated.  
These parameters can be used to generate the first address for a given seed.
```

18. The balance can be checked for one address

(a) True

(b) False

```
(a) True

Iota tokens are stored in addresses.  The balance can be checked for one or more addresses.  In order 
to get the total balance of all addresses in a seed, summarize the balances of all associated addresses
```

### Thinking ahead

19. What is a double spend? 

a) Paying twice what the item is worth 

b) Paying two people 

c) Attempting to spend funds twice 

d) Using two distributed ledgers

```
Answer:  c) Attempting to spend funds twice 

Because the ledger is distributed, trustworthiness occurs through consensus.  
However, a user may purposefully or inadvertently attempt to spend the same 
funds twice.  This is called "double spend".  Iota uses special security to
help prevent a double-spend.
```
